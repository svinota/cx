        This filesystem is exported from a python script with 9P protocol.
        Interface data is obtained realtime via rtnetlink protocol.

        9P protocol: http://9p.cat-v.org/documentation/rfc/
        Source code: http://projects.radlinux.org/cx/browser/cx/storage/iproute2fs.py

        You can get all source tree with git clone git://projects.radlinux.org/cx
        Please note, that the project is in early alpha.

        Almost all data is yet read-only, but one can change interface addresses
        just by editing interfaces/.../addresses file. Something like that:

        Set an address:
        echo 192.168.0.1/24 >interfaces/eth0/addresses

        Add one more address:
        echo -e '192.168.0.2/24\\n192.168.0.3/24' >>interfaces/eth0/addresses

        Remove an address:
        sed -i '/192.168.0.3/d' interfaces/eth0/addresses

        Flush all addresses:
        cat /dev/null >interfaces/eth0/addresses
